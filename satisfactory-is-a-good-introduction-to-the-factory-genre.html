It should be unlocked MUCH sooner.</li><li>The interesting stuff is in the MaM rather than anything you make your factory for, which sucks. <ul><li>I don't like exploring in this game, and it really sucks that the best rewards are behind exploring. It'd be like playing a platformer, and the double jump is unlocked by the optional puzzle minigame.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Sprawling factories<ul><li>3D is really cool, but it's hard to see what parts machines are producing unless you are on top of them or remember what they produce.<ul><li>When you put up walls to make things pretty this only makes things worst.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Trains<ul><li>A pain to set up, and honestly, not even sure if they are worth it.<ul><li>Signals have confusing error messages</li><li>A train has to enter the block before a path signal before it'll start figuring out if the intersection is clear, so you get these random train slowdowns if you don't plan around that. Really annoying when trains are already so slow for how spread out resources are.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>What pains me even more is that some of these issues can be things they can fix, but considering the game has been in early access for years, I think they are set on their vision which sucks.</p><p>Things being slower in 3D seems like a feature rather than a bug considering how shit their blueprint system is.</p><p>They can add more to the game, and make interesting rewards. Maybe a machine that unlocks alt recipes over time.</p><p>Being lost in your own factory can be fixed by some quality of life. I suppose I could set up more signage in my factory, but I'd rather be building more machines than writing documentation for what my factory is doing.</p><p>Trains need to be buffed, or have some sort of upgrade.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 3, 2024</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer><nav class="pagination"><div class="pagination__title"><span>Read other posts</span></div><div class="pagination__buttons"><a href="https://dayeyes.github.io/in-search-of-a-challenge-why-roguelikes-fail-at-this.html" class="btn previous" rel="prev" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION]:  In search of a novel challenge: Why Roguelikes fail at this.
